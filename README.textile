h2. inmailplugin

This is a sample project for creating an inmail and shared plugin using the LinkedIn Javascript APIs
for plugin development.

The first plugin is used for partner sites wanting to display their sponsored inmails to a user when she lands on the site.

The second plugin shows a user shares from her professional network which originate from the site itself.

The backend uses the Play! Framework with Scala.
